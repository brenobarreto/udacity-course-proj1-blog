          What predictive analytics can do for communication

          <p><b>Predictive analytics</b> uses data extracted from the history of a system to build a model capable of predicting the behavior of the same system in the face of new data. That is, it’s an analysis tool to predict future trends.</p>
          <p>And what can it do for the job of communication professionals?</p>
          <p>In a comprehensive way, it can assist in decision making and indicate the best paths towards a goal.</p>
          <p>More specifically, it can, among other things:</p> Predict the behavior of interlocutors; Identify trending topics and demands; Reinforce investment in channels, influencers or media; Provide inputs to justify campaigns or approaches; Anticipate communication crises or negative reactions; Build a proactive relationship with users; Improve reach and accuracy of messages.</p>
          <p>Let’s see a simplified example (and obviously not applicable in this format):</p>
          <p>Let’s say you work at a digital marketing agency responsible for a book publisher communications. Your team needs to roll out a new book launch campaign, and you have access to a set of data from previous campaigns.</p>
          <p>Looking at such data, you find that relating certain campaign attributes such as number of emails sent to the customer base, budget spent on Facebook ads, duration of promotional videos, it’s possible to build a model that provides insights like this one: each new email sent to customers leads to the sale of ten additional books (please never infer something like this!).</p>
          <p>So there is a coefficient which represents a fixed correlation between the number of emails sent and the number of books sold. And knowing this, your team can adjust the characteristics of the campaign in order to achieve the best possible result.</p>
          <p>This type of analysis has existed for decades, but has gained evidence in recent years because we only now have the technology to handle large volumes of data. Big Data has made it possible to create huge data sets comprehensive enough to be statistically relevant.</p>
          <p>Predictive analysis is only one of several aspects of data analysis, and even it can be approached from different angles and through a series of frameworks developed to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand the problem to be solved;</li>
            <li>Prepare the data set;</li>
            <li>Analyze these data;</li>
            <li>Create a regressive model;</li>
            <li>Validate the model;</li>
            <li>Visually present the results in a friendly way.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>According to each framework, these phases may appear in different formats, but in general this is what it is all about: collecting the data, manipulating it, building a model, applying that model, and displaying the results.</p>
          <p>There are still few communicators surfing the wave of data analysis, and it’s difficult to tell how much this trend will transform our job.</p>
          <p>For more traditional markets, such as journalism, its use is still restricted; while for marketers the analysis seems to have more immediate adhesion, having already developed into new segments such as “marketing analytics”.</p>
          <p>But the fact is what professor Christopher Martin has been saying:</p>
          <blockquote cite="https://www.google.com/">"The profession of data analyst has already become one of the most valued at the end of the decade, and its application extends to a multitude of areas, from the most obvious, such as the financial market, to the less ones, such as airlines, which use complex predictive analysis to define tickets price."</blockquote>
